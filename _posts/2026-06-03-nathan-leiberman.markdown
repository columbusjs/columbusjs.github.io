Join us for Nathan Leiberman's talk ...

Had enough of writing the same flex classes for the hundredth time? Tired of diving into your coworker’s cobbled container class? Tailwind CSS is here to save your sanity.

Tailwind gives you a well-organized, utility-first approach to styling. This CSS framework eliminates naming debates, halts stylesheet scavenger hunts, and satisfies your marketing team’s whims with clear, composable class names and a powerful configuration system. You’ll spend less time fighting CSS and more time building beautiful interfaces.

In this talk, I’ll walk through an interactive demo of Tailwind CSS and cover the following topics:

* Set up Tailwind CSS in your project
* Understand Tailwind’s utility classes and how they work
* Integrate breakpoints and dark mode like a pro
* Customizing Tailwind to fit your style
* Ditch your spaghetti stylesheets and come see how Tailwind CSS can make your project lighter, cleaner, and a lot more fun to build. Your future self will thank you.

Bring your laptop and expect to write some (non-AI-generated) code!
