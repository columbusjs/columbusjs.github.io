A JavaScript promise is a handy container for a value you expect to get later. But a promise is also a value itself, and you can do some useful stuff just knowing you have a promise.

Neal Lindsay works for [Test Double](https://testdouble.com/), where he gets to help companies write software better. He likes Javascript unironically.
