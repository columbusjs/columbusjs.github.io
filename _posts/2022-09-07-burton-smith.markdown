Web components have been around for a long time (since HTML 5 became a thing), but there hasn't been a lot of attention given to them until recently. Now, tech organizations around the world are adopting them and finding tremendous efficiency in creating framework-agnostic reusable components to build their UIs.

In this talk, we will cover what web components are, how to get started with building with them, and some of the efficiencies they bring to organizations.

### About Burton

I am a software engineer at Microsoft, working on one of their design systems.

I am also the creator of various open source projects including Kickstand UI (a design system built with web components - kickstand-ui.com) and Clarion (a style framework for managing design systems - projectclarion.com).

In my free time, I love spending time with my wife and three daughters, practicing martial arts, jamming on my ukulele, and learning new things (usually about software engineering).
