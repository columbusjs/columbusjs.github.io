title: "🎤 Modules in JavaScript"
speaker: "Jackie Gleason"
---

JavaScript is a language that was written in 10 days, but as it was adopted it evolved through organic community driven growth. This growth and the expansion of JavaScript outside of the browser, saw a need for additional features within the language. One of the most important and controversial of these was the introduction of modules and module loading. Modules increase the ability to abstract JavaScript code, allowing the complexity to be reduced and increases reusability. However, riffs in the community and slow implementation have made modules confusing for most develops. In this presentation we will take a step back and look at the history of modules in JavaScript, the different frameworks that were used to implement them and finally the ECMA Standard adopted by the working group. Once we are done you will be an ECMAScript module master!
