title: "How to Build the Virtual DOM"
speaker: "Tommy Graves"
---

For years front-end developers have bemoaned having to use the DOM; it’s slow,
inconsistent, and difficult to use. While libraries of the past provided better
ways to interface with the DOM, recent libraries like React and Vue have
instead implemented an entirely new DOM: the virtual DOM. Implementations of
the virtual DOM allow developers to create and maintain UI components using
entirely declarative interfaces that completely abstract away the real DOM. In
this session, attendees will unlock the power of the virtual DOM through a
step-by-step tutorial on the creation of a virtual DOM implementation in roughly
100 lines of code. In doing so, they will gain a precise understanding of the
advantages the virtual DOM provides to speed, maintainability, and testability.
