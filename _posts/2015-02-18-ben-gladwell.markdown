Ben Gladwell will give a talk on Gulp.js. Gulp is a popular task runner/build tool. It's powered by NodeJS and uses pipes for streaming data. There are a vast array of Gulp plugins available for tasks such as minifying code, uglifying javascript, watching files, and live-reloading the browser when files have changed.
