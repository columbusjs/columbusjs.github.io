speaker: "Brandon Rockwell"

WARNING: This is not another "React 101 - How to write Hello World in React"
talk. By now, many of us have watched all the training videos and done all the
tutorials, but what does it actually look like to bring a React application all
the way to production? In this talk, we will explore what it takes to build a
full-scale React application, from how to utilize the framework as a team, to
setting up an end-to-end software pipeline.

[Brandon Rockwell](https://twitter.com/brockthecodez) is a Columbus-based
software consultant with 5+ years of experience working with many different
technologies, and is always looking for new ways to bring JavaScript into the
hearts and minds of our community.
