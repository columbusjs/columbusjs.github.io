We're excited to launch GitHub Copilot Dev Days, a global in‑person community event series running March 15 – April 30!

Let's come together as developers, grow our local community, and showcase the power of GitHub Copilot with free, high‑quality training materials from Microsoft + GitHub.

GitHub Copilot in VS Code
GitHub Copilot CLI
… and more!

Intro Talk (30–45 min): GitHub Copilot + AI development
Local Community Talk (30–45 min): Me (Bob Fornal)
Hands‑on Workshop (1 hour): Practical exercises using GitHub Copilot

Bring your laptop and expect to write some (non-AI-generated) code!
