From the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) site:

> Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

Burton is a software engineer at Bunzl North America and has been building software and applications for over 10 years. He builds line-of-business applications and works closely with their marketing teams on external-facing websites in their CMS.

In his free time, he loves spending time with his wife and three daughters, practising my martial arts, and learning new things (usually about programming).
