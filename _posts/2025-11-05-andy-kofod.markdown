Go beyond surface-level analytics and delve into the why behind user actions. Based on insights from the Product Psychology Masterclass, this talk introduces three powerful tools: harnessing storytelling for empathy, dissecting actions with the B=MAP Behavior Model, and evaluating experience value with the Psych Framework. Discover how understanding user motivations, abilities, and mental states can lead to more intuitive and successful products.
