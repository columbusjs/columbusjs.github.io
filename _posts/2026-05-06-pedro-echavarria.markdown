This talk introduces React Hooks and explains why they were created, what problems they solve, and how they are used in real-world applications.

We will explore the core hooks such as useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef, useReducer, useMemo, and useCallback, focusing on when and why to use each one.

Through practical examples, the session demonstrates how hooks simplify component logic, improve code readability, and enable better reuse of stateful behavior through custom hooks.

The talk also covers best practices, common pitfalls, and performance considerations to help developers write clean, maintainable, and efficient React applications using hooks.

Bring your laptop and expect to write some (non-AI generated) code!
