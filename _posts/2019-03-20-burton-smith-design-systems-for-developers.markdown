speaker: "Burton Smith"

It's a common misconception that Design Systems are for designers. While this is true, they are just as much, if not more for developers. Design Systems are a collaboration tool to increase communication and reduce the time to market for your products. We will talk about what Design Systems are and how you can begin using them today.

Burton is a software engineer at Bunzl North America and has been building software and applications for over 10 years. He builds line-of-business applications and works closely with their marketing teams on external-facing websites in their CMS. In his free time, he loves spending time with his wife and three daughters, practicing my martial arts, and learning new things (usually about programming).
