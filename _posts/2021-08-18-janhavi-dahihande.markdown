Introduced in React 16.8, React Hooks have amped up the simplicity and conciseness of how React works.

In this talk, I will give a brief and beginner-friendly:

- introduction on what exactly are React hooks
- explain components of React hooks
- how to convert from current lifecycle methods to react hooks using examples
- explain how this has changed the way I code by giving real-life production examples

You will walk away with knowledge about how React hooks make your life simple and how you can use them in your projects.
