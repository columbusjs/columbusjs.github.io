In this session will talk about what is different about this generation of web
applications and how a solid development approach must consider the latency,
throughput and interactivity demand by users across both mobile devices, web browsers,
and IoT.  We will demonstrate how to include Couchbase in such applications to support
a flexible data model and easy scalability required for modern development.

We will demonstrate how to create a full stack application focusing on the CEAN stack
which is composed of Couchbase, Express Framework, AngularJS, and Node.js.
