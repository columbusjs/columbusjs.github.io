Simon Prickett shows how to get started with Kaboom.js, a JavaScript library that makes building games in the browser fast and fun! We'll start simple and build up to an adventure type game with a Node.js backend and Redis data store.

[Simon](https://simonprickett.dev) is a senior software developer and technical trainer at [Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com/). He enjoys projects that fuse hardware and software, especially with Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Simon brings experience gained from living and working on three different continents in industries including banking, logistics, IoT and Software as a Service platform development.
