speaker: "Guy Royse"

Like the rest of the world, we're online only right now. As a result, the previously scheduled speaker is not able to make the meetup. I'm planning on filling in. We've got a couple choices here:

- I live-code RedisMUD using WebSockets, Node.js, and RedisGraph.
- I give a talk called "Understanding Probabilistic Data Structures with 112,092 UFO Sightings".
- I brush and oil my beard for an hour.

Alternatively, if someone else would like to speak, I'd be happy to schedule you. Just drop me a line at guy at guy royse dot com (but, you know as an actualy email address and not this bot shielding stuff).

Thanks,
Guy
