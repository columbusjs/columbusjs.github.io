#HACK Columbus is part of an annual global hackathon by Indigitous, a movement that brings together Christian technologists, entrepreneurs, creatives, and anyone who wants to put their faith into action that's been hosted in more than 40 cities and 80 countries!

Whether you’re a coder, designer, marketer, nonprofit leader, project manager, or just curious how technology can help share God’s love, you’re welcome here. Come ready to connect, dream, and build with a missional focus.
