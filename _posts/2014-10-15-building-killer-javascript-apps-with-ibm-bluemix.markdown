title: "Building Killer Javascript Apps With IBM Bluemix"
speaker: "Ryan Baxter, Anton McConville, Nathan Vega"
---

Bluemix is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from IBM with roots deeply grounded in an open source project called Cloud Foundry. Javascript is a first class citizen when it comes to applications running on Bluemix.

The combination of Javascript and Bluemix allows developers to quickly build and deploy all types of applications to the public cloud in a matter of seconds. This talk will actually be composed of several smaller talks that show just how powerful Bluemixcan be.

We will start off with an introduction to Bluemix and show you the basics of using the platform. We will then walk you through how you would build and deploy a typical Node.js web application toBluemix. Finally, we will cover more advanced topics like the internet of things (IoT) and cognitive computing using Bluemix.

If you are at all interested in using a PaaS in your next project or want to learn about how a PaaS can change the way you build Javascript apps, we hope you will come and join us for a jam-packed evening that is sure to impress.
