Micro services are ubiquitous. However, most companies that implement micro services do not reap their full benefits - at best. At worst, it‚Äôs an epic failure.

There are reasons for micro services: independent deployment of business capabilities. However, the unspoken assumption is that you need to deploy all capabilities all the time. My experience has shown me that it‚Äôs plain wrong. Some capabilities need frequent deployment, while some are much more stable. In ‚Äúthe past‚Äù, we used Rule Engines to allow updating business rules without deployment. While it solved the problem, this approach had issues. Between introducing a Rule Engine and migrating your complete system to micro services, I believe that there‚Äôs a middle path, and that this path is Function-as-a-Service.

In this talk, I‚Äôll detail every point I‚Äôve made above, and show how one can use Serverless to pragmatically design a system that allows deploying as often as you need.
