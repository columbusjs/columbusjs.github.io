title: "Halt and Catch Fire: Who really needs NoSQL?"
speaker: "Matthew Groves"
---

This session will begin with a brief introduction to NoSQL. Relational databases have worked on past projects. Why change now? Is NoSQL just a buzzword with no real substance? What can it do that relational can’t? What about all those horror stories and memes?

We’ll look at the best use cases for non-relational databases, how projects have succeeded and failed, and the tools and patterns for using NoSQL and SQL together. If scaling, flexibility, and speed are major concerns on your radar, or if you’re skeptical that the world needs anything but relational, then this session is for you.

This session will look at NoSQL through the lens of the characters from the Halt and Catch Fire TV show: Do you work with a “visionary” like Joe who thinks NoSQL will solve every problem? Are you an engineer like Gordon who doesn’t want to rush into it? Are you like Cameron and just want to smash the big establishment databases? Do you know a Tom who distrusts open-source? Or are you more like Donna and want to find a sensible approach that uses the best of both worlds? Come to this session to find out if you really need NoSQL.
